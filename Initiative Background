# State of the World

The way UI systems are typically procured and managed today - as monoliths - makes it difficult for states to adapt systems quickly and leverage emerging technologies. This “all or nothing” paradigm also forces states into a choice between maintaining their legacy technology far longer than they would like or embarking on an expensive and risky system overhaul that often either fails to deliver desired results or delivers short-lived results that require repeating the overhaul process a few years later. 

# Our Theory of Change

Within the context of all the other things going on in the broader UI modernization world, the Open UI Initiative is specifically looking to:  
* Establish a common framework and approach for modular UI system development, 
* Create market-based incentives that drive innovation, and 
* Provide more choices for states in terms of how they invest in technology to meet the goals of the UI program. 

This will include efforts to foster an ecosystem of open and modular solutions enables more flexible and resilient IT systems, while driving efficiencies in software development and acquisition, and creating new opportunities for states and vendors to collaborate on solutions.
