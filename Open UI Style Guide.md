# Open UI Initiative Team – Writing, Voice, and Style Guide
--------------
## General Writing Guidelines

Some guidelines to consider when writing for NASWA and the Open UI Initiative are to: 

- Be Transparent: When possible and appropriate, explain the reasoning behind decisions and strategies. Your communication should share what avenues were considered, or explored and ultimately not pursued.  Do share what worked, what did not work and why. 
  
- Be Informative: Our stakeholders should understand the information being communicated to them and easily navigate topics of interest. It is best practice to avoid jargon/ambiguity, define terms and acronyms and do not assume what stakeholders may or may not know. Writing should be approachable, use plain language and be appropriate for the specific audience. 
 
- Be Welcoming: Feedback should always be welcomed from our stakeholders and anyone interested/invested in our work. Be open to different points of view in the pursuit of delivering the best possible content.

# Voice

NASWA’s “Voice” should reflect our values, conveying that we are experienced, compassionate partners. Voice should remain consistent regardless of the audience or the format. 

- Use plain language: As we work with states to help them enhance their communications, NASWA must serve as an example for members to follow. Aim to write in simple and straightforward terms. 

- Be respectful: Acknowledge all the ongoing hard work by states, the federal government, advocates, employers and claimants. 

# Tone

While NASWA’s voice remains consistent across different formats and audiences, “tone” can adapt to each situation and audience. For example, tone will differ for a conference presentation versus a board presentation. In general, NASWA’s tone is *professional but approachable*.  

A ‘professional but approachable’ tone is direct, confident and thorough while also conveying respect and clarity. ‘Professional’ emphasizes facts and references data or rationales when explaining opinions or points of view.  

NASWA’s audiences include workforce professionals in a variety of roles. Content should be understood by all due to the wide variety of people our work could impact. 

## Writing Style Tips

**Write for all readers.** While NASWA’s primary stakeholder is its members, the content may be read by a wide audience, ranging from employers to claimants. NASWA’s work may gather the interest of those who are unfamiliar with the nuances yet still invested in the outcomes of what we do.  

While some of NASWA’s content will be very technical in nature, default to using best practices when you can, aiming to write content as accessible as possible. 

**Focus on your message.** Begin with the most important point or message. Group related ideas together and use descriptive headers and subheadings to create a hierarchy of information that is easy to read and comprehend.  

**Be concise and specific.** Use short words and sentences and avoid unnecessary phrases (e.g., ‘in order to’ vs. ‘to’). Avoid using adverbs unless required for clarity (e.g., 'very difficult’ vs. ‘difficult’). Avoid vague language or clarify phrases that might have other meanings in different contexts, such as UI (unemployment insurance versus user interface).  

# Active Voice

Use active voice and avoid passive voice, if possible. 

In active voice, the subject of the sentence performs the action. In passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action performed to it. Passive voice can make sentences unclear and vague because they shift focus away from the subject and make it unclear who is responsible. They can also sound wordy, indirect and can take up more space on the page. 

Example: 

✅The user logged into the account. 

❌The account was logged into by the user. 

 

Words such as “was” and “by” are common in sentences written in passive voice and can be good to scan for in your document when checking for active vs. passive voice. 

*Exception* - when you want to specifically emphasize an action. 

- “The account was flagged by the investigations team.” 

In other words, default to active voice and use your judgment on where passive voice might communicate a more appropriate tone or point of view. NASWA Communications can provide guidance and editing expertise. 

## Abbreviations and acronyms 

As a general rule, spell out abbreviations on the first mention with the abbreviated form in parentheses next to it.  

- First use: National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) 

- Second use: NASWA 


If the abbreviation or acronym is well known, such as HTML, it can be used without writing out the full word on first use. 

If your documentation includes a high number of acronyms, consider including a glossary as an appendix.  

A list of common abbreviations that should be completely spelled out on first usage can be found below.  

- U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL) 

- Employment and Training Administration (ETA) 

- Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) 

- American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) 

- Technical Advisory Group (TAG) 

- National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) 

- UI Information Technology Support Center (UI ITSC) 

These are just a few select terms that commonly come up in NASWA’s writing. 

**Do not abbreviate Open UI Initiative, it is spelled out every time.**

## Capitalization 

Capitalization rules change depending on the format and type of content. Title case capitalizes the first letter of every word in a sentence or phrase except articles, prepositions and conjunctions. Sentence case capitalizes the first letter of the first word in a sentence. Some examples are included below. 
  

Email addresses and websites 

When writing out an email address or website URL, use all lowercase. Watch out for autocorrect! 

- username@naswa.org 

- naswa.org 

## Words within sentences 

Do not capitalize words in the middle of sentences unless they are proper nouns. Here are some words that are never capitalized in a sentence: 

- unemployment 

- modernize / modernization 

- website 

- state

## Contractions 

Avoid contractions in most long-form writing in order to maintain a professional tone. 

Instances where contractions may be okay to use are presentations where slide space is at a premium. 

## Writing about other companies 

Refer to other company websites for naming, spelling and capitalization conventions for their products and organizations. Some examples below: 

- iPhone 

- YouTube 

- Google Search 


## Slang and jargon 

Write in plain, easy-to-understand terms. If you need to use a technical term, briefly define it so everyone can understand. 

# AP Style

NASWA follows [AP Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP_Stylebook). NASWA Communications can help you adhere to AP style. Occasional exceptions may be made for space constraints or clarity, such as in a social media post. The following are some AP style basics to keep in mind:  

## Punctuation 

NASWA <u>does not use</u> the Oxford Comma.  

- In a simple series, use commas to separate elements, but do not put a comma before the conjunction/last item in the list. (ex: The muffin recipe required flour, eggs and milk.)  

- Include the final comma only if omitting it would make the meaning unclear. 

- Include the final comma before the concluding conjunction if another element of the sentence requires a conjunction. (ex: Some classic sandwiches include BLT, tuna salad, grilled chicken, and peanut butter and jelly.)

## Numbers 

Spell out numbers that begin a sentence. 

Spell out numbers one through nine. 

Use numerals for 10 and above 

- Example: One million people filed for unemployment the week of October 7, 2024. 

Use numerals for figures, dimensions and percentages 

Expressions that typically use spelled-out numbers can be left that way. 

- Example: That is a third-party integration. 

Numbers over three digits get commas: 

- 999 

- 1,000 

- 150,000 

Write out large numbers in full. Abbreviate them if there are space restraints, as in a presentation or a chart: 1k, 150k, 1.5 million.

## Dates 

Spell out the month, use numbers instead of ordinal numbers, and include the year. 

✅ January 1, 2024 

❌ January 1st, 2024 


## Decimals and fractions 

Spell out fractions. 

✅: two-thirds 

❌: 2/3 

Use decimal points for numbers that would be difficult to write out as a fraction, like 4.575 or 50.5 

## Percentages 

Use the % symbol instead of spelling out "percent." 


## Ranges and spans 

Use a hyphen (-) to indicate a range between numbers 

- It takes 20-30 days. 

## Time 

Use numerals and a.m. or p.m., with a space between. 

- 7 a.m. 

- 7:30 p.m. 

Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.  

- 7 a.m.–10:30 p.m. 

Specify time zones when writing about an event or meeting. Since the NASWA office is in Washington D.C., we default to ET.

## URLs and websites 

Capitalize the names of websites and web publications. Don’t italicize. 

In general, avoid writing out full URLs, but when you need to, leave off the [http://www.](http://www.)

## State Names 

Generally, spell out state names and do not abbreviate them unless needed for spacing reasons.
