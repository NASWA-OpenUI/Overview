# Open UI Initiative's Frequently Asked Questions

## What is the Open UI Initiative? 
The Open UI Initiative (Open UI) was created to help address the well documented challenges and risks in state Unemployment Insurance systems through the creation of a technical framework and functional definitions of a state UI system that is modular and therefore more adaptable, scalable, and provides a better user experience to claimants, employers, and state agency staff. The Initiative seeks to create not only technical definitions and documentation but also establish and grow a community of states, vendors, and other stakeholders who can contribute, comment, and iterate modular approaches and implementations.   

The Open UI Initiative seeks to create a blueprint, or framework, of an unemployment insurance (UI) system, based on the structure of UI systems across the U.S. We are calling this the Open UI Initiative Framework, and states and vendors can use this framework as a guide to develop their own UI software or to modernize existing systems with the flexibility to fit their policies and workflows.  

The framework will follow a modularized approach, or one where the system is sectioned by key functionalities, allowing for the ability to update, change, or replace parts of the system as needed rather than needing to overhaul the entire system all at once. The framework will describe how the modules will communicate with each other, or be interoperable, as well as how they will communicate with other external systems. 

## Where can I learn more about the Initiative? 
See our [About the Initiative page](https://github.com/NASWA-OpenUI/Overview/blob/main/About%20the%20Initiative.md) on GitHub, or visit the [Open UI Initiative website](www.naswa.org/open-ui-initiative). There you’ll find links to helpful resources and more information about the Initiative. If you have more questions about the Open UI Initiative, please send an email to openui@naswa.org and include your question and your contact information. 

## How is the Open UI Initiative funded? 

The Open UI Initiative is currently funded by a grant from the US Department of Labor for a term of three years that ends September 30, 2026. The Initiative operates out of the National Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA) alongside the Unemployment Insurance Information Technology Support Center (UI ITSC) at NASWA. 

## Will the Open UI Initiative include working code?  

As of March 2025, the Initiative is not seeking to create, procure, or otherwise develop working code for the modules. As the Initiative evolves this may be a part of the roadmap. To keep up to date on the latest developments in the Open UI Initiative please visit [our website](www.naswa.org/open-ui-initiative).

## Is the Open UI Initiative considered “Open Source”? 

The materials created by or contributed to the Initiative are available under an Apache 2.0 license. To learn more about what is allowed under this type of license, please visit our [license documentation](https://github.com/NASWA-OpenUI/Overview/blob/main/LICENSE).

## What does the Open UI Initiative mean by the word “open”?  
The Initiative recognizes that there are number of interpretations to the first word in our name, Open. We’ve come to define it in three ways: 
* We are open in our way of working with states, vendors, and others who want to contribute to the vision of the Initiative   
* We aim to open the UI technology marketplace to new ideas, vendors, and approaches   
* We see value and opportunity in open source software and communities
