# Open UI Initiative Community Guidelines


## Our Pledge

The Open UI Initiative Team at NASWA (the Open UI team), acting as leaders, contributors, and stewards of the Open UI community (the community), pledge to make participation in the community a harassment-free experience for everyone and pledge to support members of the community and their contributions, regardless of an individual’s background or defining characteristics. 

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include: 

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people  
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback  
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience  
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community 
* Keeping content and contributions relevant to Open UI Initiative’s purpose and objectives 
* Crediting sources and accurately representing authorship 

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Public or private harassment  
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without their explicit permission  
* Misrepresenting others’ work as your own 
* Spamming, including posting irrelevant content, self-promotional material, or other content that is unrelated to the Open UI Initiative community’s purpose 
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

The Open UI team at NASWA, acting as community stewards, is responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

Community stewards have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to these Community Guidelines, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate. 

## Scope

These Community Guidelines apply within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing the community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community stewards responsible for enforcement at openui@naswa.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. 

All community stewards are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
